English | [简体中文](./sig-memsafety_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

Describe the Mission and objectives of the new SIG, including but not limited to:

- Why create a new SIG in openEuler

  With the development of technology, security is no longer optional in today's world. Frequent security breaches are affecting everyone's work and life more and more seriously. The Rust language is inherently designed for concurrency and safety, and draws on the characteristics of process-oriented/object-oriented/functional languages. This sig mainly involves Rust language refactoring and memory safety related projects.

- The scope of the SIG

  System-level services and tools.

- Which SIGs in openEuler to coorperate with

  Rust、security-facility.


### Deliverables

What and in what form the SIG is responsible for delivering

- Source code

- tar

- Source and tar


### Repositories and description managed by this SIG


### Cross-domain and external-oriented processes

Cross-domain and externally-oriented processes and actions defined and implemented by this SIG:

- Non-Internal Process Checklist

- The organization guidance plan for the entire openEulerSIG owned by this SIG, etc.
